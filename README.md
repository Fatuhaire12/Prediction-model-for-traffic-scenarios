Prediction model for traffic Scenarios
Input: traffic database from transport UK
Output: traffic scenarios.
My role was to:
a. Create time-dependent traffic scenarios for different junction by sampling from historic data (take into date and time).
b. Generate future traffic scenarios: on day x at time y there will be speed z between junction k and l.
